I will use examples from my own art practice to show the  impossibility to engange in digital and real-life actionism as they are considered criminal under anti-terrorist laws.","description":"In the past, whenever we decided to start a new project, we always thought about possible legal implications in advance. Usually these would be easy to ignore as these implications used to result in small fines for public disturbance, copyright infringement, and your average threatening lawyer's letter. By now, anti-terrorist laws disable us to think freely about projects and issues that touch state authority and terrorism, because thinking terror already consitutes a crime. Hence we changed our strategy and went into the underground with \"illegal art\", we have decided to publish such projects anonymously and internally we call them our \"Secret Projects\". We can never be connected to what we artistically do in the underground. But I will present the changing social habitat and legal circumstances affecting the production process for artists by showcasing some of our key UBERMORGEN projects and revealing as little as possible about our \"Secret Projects\". \r\n\r\nIn my talk I need to call to attention the many cases of self-censorship that every user on the net takes part in, the immensly negative effects of this lemming-like behavior and the reflection of this downward spiral in the revolting newspeak that has taken over the mass media and the lovely commercial social networks. Because what we are experiencing right now by means of a soft transformation, is a totalitarian take-over while the majority of the artists are focused on career, money and reputation instead of resistance, subversion and reflection.

After that it introduces the necessary tools, gives tips on how to detect the processor architecture, and explains some more advanced analysis techniques, including how to figure out the offsets where the firmware is loaded to, and how to start the investigation.","description":"The talk focuses on the different steps to be taken to acquire and analyze the firmware of an embedded device, especially without knowing anything about the processor architecture in use. Frequently datasheets are not available or do not name any details about the used processor or System on Chip (SoC).\r\n\r\nFirst the prerequisites, like knowledge about the device under investigation, the ability to read assembly language, and the tools of the trade for acquisition and analysis, are shown.\r\n\r\nThe question \"How do I get the firmware out of device X?\" makes the next big chapter: From easy to hard we pass through the different kinds of storage systems and locations a firmware can be stored to, the different ways the firmware gets transferred onto the device, and which tools we can use to retrieve the firmware from where it resides.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to analyze the gathered data. Is it compressed in any way? For which of the various different processor architectures out there was it compiled for? Once we successfully figured out the CPU type and we've found a matching disassembler, where do we start to analyze the code? Often we have to find out the offset where the firmware is loaded to, to get an easy-to-analyze disassembler output. A technique to identify these offsets will be shown.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter covers the modifications we can apply to the firmware, and what types of checksum mechanisms are known to be used by the device or the firmware itself to check the integrity of the code.\r\n\r\n","persons":[{"id":4216,"full_public_name":"Stefan Widmann"}],"links":[]},{"id":5281,"logo":"/system/logos/5281/medium/Logo.png?1388072379","date":"2013-12-27T14:00:00+01:00","start":"14:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5281_-_de_-_saal_1_-_201312271400_-_keine_anhaltspunkte_fur_flachendeckende_uberwachung_-_martin_haase_maha_-_khamacher","title":"Keine Anhaltspunkte für flächendeckende Überwachung","subtitle":"Die Diskussion um NSA, PRISM, Tempora sprachlich und logisch aufgearbeitet","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Die Enthüllungen Edward Snowdens haben die deutsche Politik für kurze Zeit in Aufregung gebracht. Für eine Beruhigung reichte es bereits aus, die Enthüllungen in sprachlich-logisch cleverer Weise zu verarbeiten, sie teilweise in ein anderen Kontext zu stellen und so schließlich Entwarnung geben zu können: Die Bundesregierung hat „keine Anhaltspunkte für flächendeckende Überwachung“.\r\n\r\nBei diesem Vorgehen handelt sich um ein Paradebeispiel dafür, wie mit einfachen sprachlich-rhetorischen Tricks die politisch Verantwortlichen die Öffentlichkeit und sich selbst so weit täuschten, dass es ihnen nicht mehr nötig erschien, sich mit den eigentlichen Problemen auseinanderzusetzen, und so das leidige Thema aus dem Wahlkampf herausgehalten werden konnte. Neben den mittlerweile zum Standard gehörenden „Basta“-Floskeln spielte das Phänomen der Modalisierung eine besondere Rolle, wie die genauere Analyse zeigt. Auch logische Fehler wie Zirkelschlüssel und (zu) strikte Einschränkung des thematischen Bezugs erlaubten diese „Flucht-nach-vorne“-Strategie. Die Häufung sprachlicher Tricks und des logisch-inhaltlichen Ausweichens legen eine Inszenierung nahe.","description":"Die im Bundestag vertretenen Parteien äußerten sich alle zu den Snowden-Enthüllungen. Erwartungsgemäß griff die Opposition die Regierung scharf an, während die Regierung sehr schnell dabei war abzuwiegeln – zunächst eher ungeschickt. Dann trat eine überraschende Wende ein: Plötzlich waren sich alle einig, dass die NSA-Affäre vorbei sei. Selbst die Opposition beruhigte sich, die zunächst davon gesprochen hatte, Merkel habe ihren Amtseid gebrochen. Interessant ist, dass die Wende vor allem sprachlich vollzogen wurde, wie sich an den Äußerungen sehr schön zeigen lässt. Vor allem die Verwendung auffälliger Adverbien, von Zirkelschlüssen und die teilweise drastische Einschränkung der Bezüge sind entlarvend.

Different words are used because the techniques to trigger the faulty memory access and to subsequently use that to gain code execution vary, but they all share a common root cause: violation of spatial and temporal memory safety.</p>\r\n<p>If one looks at the C/C++ standard, the situations that tend to be exploitable are \"unspecified\". Usually, compiler writers take that as an excuse to cut corners, to gain that extra bit of performance in the benchmarks. Because, you know, who cares you're exploitable when you make a mistake, look how fast it is!</p>\r\n<p>However, the standards also allow the compiler to introduce safety checks, to see whether access to a pointer actually touches the inside of an allocated object instead of the outside (spatial memory safety), and to make sure that the pointer being accessed actually points to an object that has been allocated, but not yet been freed again (temporal memory safety). Such compilers do exist, in the form of LLVM with specialized optimizer passes that introduce runtime safety checks.</p>\r\n<p>This talk will look into the details of the implementation, the performance impact, practical handling, and of course, whether it really delivers the promised 100% protection against buffer overflows.</p>","persons":[{"id":1190,"full_public_name":"Andreas Bogk"}],"links":[]},{"id":5622,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-27T19:30:00+01:00","start":"19:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5622_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312271930_-_30c3_keynote_-_glenn_greenwald_-_frank","title":"30c3 Keynote","subtitle":"","track":"CCC","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"via videolink.","description":"","persons":[{"id":4428,"full_public_name":"Glenn Greenwald"},{"id":1633,"full_public_name":"frank"}],"links":[{"url":"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page","title":"30c3"}]},{"id":5423,"logo":"/system/logos/5423/medium/tor-king.png?1387813809","date":"2013-12-27T20:30:00+01:00","start":"20:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5423_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312272030_-_the_tor_network_-_jacob_-_arma","title":"The Tor Network","subtitle":"We're living in interesting times","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum will discuss contemporary Tor Network issues related to censorship, security, privacy and anonymity online.","description":"The last several years have included major cryptographic upgrades in the Tor network, interesting academic papers in attacking the Tor network, major high profile users breaking news about the network itself, discussions about funding, FBI/NSA exploitation of Tor Browser users, botnet related load on the Tor network and other important topics.\r\n\r\nThis talk will clarify many important topics for the Tor community and for the world at large.","persons":[{"id":1083,"full_public_name":"Jacob"},{"id":1785,"full_public_name":"arma"}],"links":[]},{"id":5618,"logo":"/system/logos/5618/medium/hexagon.png?1385629822","date":"2013-12-27T21:45:00+01:00","start":"21:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5618_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312272145_-_baseband_exploitation_in_2013_-_rpw_esizkur","title":"Baseband Exploitation in 2013","subtitle":"Hexagon challenges","track":"Security & Safety","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Exploitation of baseband vulnerabilities has become significantly harder on average.

It is implemented in a software tool of the same name, released by the BSI, which is only available where there is a public interest for its use. However, the GSTOOL, a database application for security audit management also released by the BSI, contains an encryption feature using the CHIASMUS block cipher, and is freely available. This software was developed by a third party, Steria Mummert Consulting, and apparently was not properly reviewed.\r\n\r\nWe disassembled and analyzed the GSTOOL to obtain the specification for the encrypted files (and thus the CHIASMUS cipher itself), but we got more than we bargained for.

Before the relatively new method of computerized encryption software converting data into a format unintelligible to anyone lacking the necessary key for its decryption, for a long time there was pen and paper and the human brain doing quite a bit of work. Up until the 20th century encryption had to be done literally by hand, to then be transmitted in paper form, via telegraphy or radio. In this context, encryption of data has always been of special importance during times of political conflict and war; subsequently, it saw its major developments during those times in history. This talk will examine and explain common hand encryption methods still employed today using the example of one very successful Soviet espionage group operating in Japan in the 1930s and 1940s: the spy ring centered around Richard Sorge, codenamed “Ramsay”.","description":"In the summer of 1938, the Japanese Secret Police started to notice mysterious radio transmissions emanating from somewhere in the Tokyo area. These transmissions, consisting of seemingly meaningless groups of digits, seemed to be directed towards the Asian mainland; neither the Secret Police nor the Japanese Communications Ministry and the Communications Bureau of the Governor General of Korea were able to pinpoint the where and from more precisely. It wasn't until 1941 that Japanese authorities uncovered the full scope and meaning of these messages – by accident and at first disbelieving what they had unearthed.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly gibberish radio transmissions did indeed emanate from the heart of Tokyo and, as it turned out, were received in Vladivostok and passed on to Moscow, to be presented to Stalin himself. Decrypted, they contained vital information about secret German and Japanese plans, even the date of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. This information had been gathered by Richard Sorge, a German citizen with a colorful personality who had infiltrated the small German community in Japan under the guise of a journalist and even gained the friendship and trust of the German ambassador, giving him access to any information available inside the embassy of Japan's ally.\r\n\r\nIn Japan since 1933, Sorge had built a spy ring around a small group of confidantes: a Japanese journalist with connections to powerful Japanese political circles, a French-Yugoslav communist, and a German radio technician, Max Clausen.\r\n\r\nClausen's technical knowledge proved vital for the group's success: he was able to build a transmitter and receiver capable of reaching up to 4,000 km from scratch, using parts available in Tokyo shops without raising suspicion. His radio station was fully portable in a large briefcase and assembled in under 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe dispatches transmitted to the Soviet Union by Sorge's group were written in English and then converted into digits using a straddling checkerboard and, to scramble the content even more, a book cipher, using pages from a statistical yearbook as the key. The Japanese authorities were not able to decipher the messages, Sorge's encryption method remained unbroken until Max Clausen explained it himself after his arrest in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of Sorge's espionage material remains a controversial issue among historians; some call him the greatest spy of all times, some argue that since Stalin did not trust his information, Sorge had little influence on the outcome of World War II. Instead of trying to settle this argument, my talk will examine the technical aspects of Sorge's work in Japan: I will describe the DIY radio station used to wirelessly transmit his dispatches over thousands of kilometers and show how these dispatches were manually encrypted using nothing but a pen, paper, and a book – suggesting that this method is still valid today, offering low-tech ways of concealing information, be it private or politically delicate material.","persons":[{"id":4221,"full_public_name":"Anja Drephal"}],"links":[]},{"id":5305,"logo":"/system/logos/5305/medium/03.jpg?1378757193","date":"2013-12-27T23:00:00+01:00","start":"23:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal G","slug":"30C3_-_5305_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312272300_-_breaking_baryons_-_michael_buker","title":"Breaking Baryons","subtitle":"On the Awesomeness of Particle Accelerators and Colliders","track":"Science & Engineering","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"A light-hearted presentation about many aspects of particle accelerators like the LHC and their particle collision experiments.

Instead of using concrete data values SE uses symbolic values to evaluate a large set of parallel program paths at once. A drawback of many systems is that they need source code access and only scale to few lines of code. This talk explains how SE and binary analysis can be used to (i) reverse-engineer components of binary only applications and (ii) construct specific concrete input that triggers a given condition deep inside the application (think of defining an error condition and the SE engine constructs the input to the application that triggers the error).","description":"Analysis and reverse engineering of binary programs is cumbersome. Consider the problem that we have a given interesting (error) condition inside the program that we want to trigger. How can we generate a specific input to the program that, during the execution of the program, will trigger the condition. In this talk we use a combination of binary analysis techniques that recover high-level control-flow and data-flow information from a binary-only application and Symbolic Execution (SE) to automate the analysis of such problems. Existing SE tools have often been used to achieve high coverage across all code paths in an application to find implementation bugs. We use SE for a different purpose; given a vulnerability condition hidden deep inside the application what is the input that triggers that condition.\r\n\r\nWe tackle the given problem in three major steps: (i) gathering information about the binary, (ii) analyzing the information-flow and control-flow of the binary, and (iii) using symbolic execution to generate a specific input example that triggers the specified condition. During the information gathering process we define the interesting condition and use regular analysis techniques to set-up later stages. In the information-flow and control-flow analysis we use a given sample input to collect a complete execution trace of the application that is then parsed into a graph that dissects the computation of the application into individual components. The last steps uses fuzzBall, our open-source SE engine to compute specific vulnerability-triggering inputs for the identified components.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate our technique we will show several examples using real programs, showing how we can use specific vulnerability conditions to automatically generate input that triggers this condition. In addition, we will show how our SE engine can be used for other interesting analysis on binary only applications. Our tools are available as open-source and we invite other hackers to join in on this project.","persons":[{"id":2410,"full_public_name":"gannimo"}],"links":[{"url":"https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball","title":"Tools are available as open-source"}]},{"id":5509,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-27T16:00:00+01:00","start":"16:00","duration":"00:30","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5509_-_de_-_saal_6_-_201312271600_-_ifgint_-_stefan_wehrmeyer","title":"IFGINT","subtitle":"Erkenntnisse aus Informationsfreiheitsanfragen - Hacks, Bugs, Workarounds ","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Mit Informationsfreiheitsgesetz (IFG) und FragDenStaat.de kann man als Bürger den Staat einfach zurücküberwachen.

We examine ethical aspects of modern surveillance technologies by looking at debates around crowd control and face recognition in the age that first imagined, and reflected on, the surveillance state.","description":"1819 saw a craze in Britain for German mechanic Karl Von Drais’s Laufmaschine – a two-wheeled, peddleless wooden precursor of the bicycle dubbed “velocipede” or “dandy charger”. As well as recreational uses, military and police applications were quickly proposed for this futuristic technology. On 1 September 1819, The Tickler magazine imagined squadrons of “Dandy Dragoons” being used to police “public spectacles”. There was a serious point beneath the humour. Just two weeks earlier, brutal policing by soliders on horseback led to the deaths of protestors at a public meeting that became known as the Peterloo Massacre. We consider the Drais-maschine as a “hacked horse”, but one that caused public anxiety as well as fashionable interest. We consider Romantic debates around the proposed use of velocipedes for “home service”, since they strikingly anticipate contemporary discussions about drone deployment in homeland security contexts. We ask what light these early debates throw on our own misgivings about the “teching-up” of surveillance agencies.\r\n\r\nWe look at two “public spectacles” in the Romantic period. The first is the “Triumphant Entry into London” on 13 September 1819 of popular radical politician Henry Hunt to answer treason charges following his participation at Peterloo. The poet John Keats was among the 30,000-strong crowd who lined the streets to welcome him, and from his letters we have an eyewitness account. The second – related – “public spectacle” is imagined in a painting entitled “Christ’s Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem” by Keats’s friend B. R. Haydon. Haydon included Keats’s face in the crowd, as well as those of other poets and philosophers, including Voltaire and Newton. Critics of the painting referred to the “gross anachronism” of their presence – in another sense, though, they are merely in the wrong place, at the wrong time (Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort). Both spectacles offer a bridge to a consideration of ethical aspects to C21 surveillance technology.\r\n\r\nThe final part of our talk focuses on Romanticism’s understanding of the interpretive role of face recognition. Modern software promises to turn facial features into objective, mathematical space, though arguably fails to move beyond the subjective heuristic space into which viewers of Haydon’s canvas were invited two hundred years ago. Modern face-tracking software’s act of recognition is always an act of imagining the subject’s relation to wrong-doing. The identified face in the crowd summons his or her “unenrolled” Doppelgänger, where individuals occupy a quantum-like state of uncertainty until a measurement is made against a crime – a problem to which Haydon’s painting seems supremely attuned.\r\n\r\nThe talk as a whole builds on our previous exploration at 29C3 of ways in which post-Enlightenment art, poetry and political philosophy is relevant to C21 discussions about surveillance culture.\r\n\r\n°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°\r\nProfessor Richard Marggraf Turley is Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination at Aberystwyth University.

People are more aware of their routine, let’s them improve their physical life, fostering better eating and exercise habits, decreasing the risk for any obesity related diseases, increasing the quality of life.  Physical activity recognition is becoming mainstream. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, research in activity recognition has focused on identifying physical tasks performed by the user through setting up elaborate, dedicated sensors in the lab. Yet, in recent years, physical activity recognition has become more mainstream. As industry begins to apply advances suggested by activity recognition research, we see more and more commercial products that help people track their physical fitness, from simple step counting (e.g., Fitbit One, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Withings Pulse) over sports expertise tracking (e.g. Runkeeper, Strava) to sleep monitoring.\r\nWe see also the first smartphone applications giving users an overview about their activities, for example “Human” and “Move”, just to name two. Their tracking abilities are still limited by the battery power of today’s smart phones. Yet, with the just announced M7 Chip in the new iPhone 5s (making it easy to aggregate and interpret sensor data in a power efficient manner), we can expect physical activity tracking will be sooner or later integrated in our smart phones and other everyday appliances.\r\n\r\nWhile people explored the problem of physical activity recognition thoroughly, the ability to detect cognitive activities is an area with many challenges. This exciting new research field, Cognitive Quantified Self, opens up new opportunities at the intersection of wearable computing, machine learning, psychology, and cognitive science. In this talk I  focus on tracking reading (the cognitive process of decoding letters, words, and sentences) in a mobile setting using optical eye tracking and occasionally first person vision (a camera worn on the users head).\r\n\r\nWe want to establish long-term tracking of many mental processes suggesting strategies to optimize mental fitness and cognitive well-being.\r\n\r\nImagine, educators can get real-time feedback about the attention level and learning progress of their students, giving them a good grasp on already understood and potential difficult concepts. Learning material can be redesigned and tailored towards the needs of the individual student, given their reading/learning history, their preferences and life-style.\r\n\r\nContent creators can use the quantified mind logs as a basis for improving their works. In which part of the movie are users most attentive? What feelings are conveyed by a particular paragraph in a book convey? In case you are a researcher, wouldn’t you like to know at what sentence a reader looses interest in your grant proposal?\r\n\r\nAnd we finally can tackle more difficult to analyze lifestyle issues, given a large enough user group and good enough sensing. e.g. How do sleep and eating habits influence our attention and learning?\r\n","persons":[{"id":1891,"full_public_name":"Kai"}],"links":[{"url":"http://kaikunze.de","title":"Kai's Homepage"},{"url":"http://kaikunze.de/papers/kunze2013wordometer.pdf","title":"Wordometer Paper"},{"url":"http://kaikunze.de/papers/kunze2013activity.pdf","title":"Cognitive Activity Recognition Paper"}]},{"id":5212,"logo":"/system/logos/5212/medium/gnu_in_net.png?1387562656","date":"2013-12-27T21:45:00+01:00","start":"21:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5212_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312272145_-_the_gnu_name_system_-_grothoff","title":"The GNU Name System","subtitle":"A Decentralized PKI For Social Movements","track":"Security & Safety","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"DNS, DNSSEC and the X.509 CA system leak private information about users to server operators and fail to provide adequate security against modern adversaries.

It is thus a target for attackers trying to suppress free access to information. This talk introduces the design and implementation of the GNU Name System (GNS), a fully decentralized and censorship-resistant name system.  GNS provides an privacy-enhancing alternative to DNS and existing public key infrastructures (such as X.509 certificate authorities), while giving users the desirable property of memorable names.  The design of GNS incorporates the possibility of integration and coexistence with DNS.\r\n\r\nGNS builds on ideas from the Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI), addressing a central issue with the decentralized mapping of secure identifiers to memorable names: namely the impossibility of providing a global, secure and memorable mapping without a trusted authority, also known as Zooko's triangle. GNS uses the transitivity in the SDSI design to replace the trusted root with secure delegation of authority, thus making petnames useful to other users while operating under the strong adversary model assumed by Zooko.\r\n\r\nIn addition to describing the GNS design, this talk also discusses some of the mechanisms that are needed to smoothly integrate GNS with existing processes and procedures in Web browsers.

However, ABC use complex cryptography to achieve their privacy preserving properties, thus far evading efficient implementations on such smart cards. The IRMA (I Reveal My Attributes) project of the Radboud University Nijmegen (together with SURFnet and TNO) has created the first full and efficient implementation of this technology on smart cards. The implementation is based on the Idemix technology orginally developed by IBM. The smart card is contactless, to allow NFC enabled smart phones and tablets as readers. This makes it easy to use IRMA cards on the web, or to prove credentials in a small shop on the tablet owned by the shopkeeper. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss ABCs in general, the IRMA system and it's implementation particular, and give a demo of how an IRMA card can be used in practice (using a smart phone as the card reader).

We will especially discuss the risk of having a ubiquitous authentication infrastructure that ABCs would provide when implemented on national identity cards, and outline ways to mitigate these risks.\r\n","persons":[{"id":3999,"full_public_name":"Jaap-Henk Hoepman"}],"links":[{"url":"http://www.irmacard.org","title":"IRMA website"}]},{"id":5537,"logo":"/system/logos/5537/medium/lambda-labs-logo_180x180.png?1379290790","date":"2013-12-28T12:45:00+01:00","start":"12:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5537_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312281245_-_glass_hacks_-_stephen_balaban","title":"Glass Hacks","subtitle":"Fun and frightening uses of always-on camera enabled wearable computers","track":"Science & Engineering","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"A one hour technical lecture that covers everything from machine learning and AI to hardware design and manufacture.

Sie ist vielmehr der bisherige Höhepunkt in einer über sechzigjährigen Geschichte der Überwachung Deutschlands. Seit dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wird dieses Land systematisch überwacht. Die Bundesrepublik ist wichtiges Angriffsziel, aber auch wichtiger Partner der amerikanischen Geheimdienste. Verfassungsschutz und Bundesnachrichtendienst sind Ziehkinder der amerikanischen und britischen Besatzungsmächte, zu engster Zusammenarbeit und zum Austausch aller Nachrichten, einschließlich personenbezogener Daten, bis heute verpflichtet.\r\n\r\nOhne einen Blick in die Geschichte ist die aktuelle Affäre kaum zu verstehen. Mit seinem Buch „Überwachtes Deutschlands“, das neun Monate vor Beginn der NSA-Affäre erschienen ist, hat der Freiburger Historiker Josef Foschepoth historisch-politisches Neuland betreten. Erstmals wird deutlich, wie stark die Westmächte auf die innere Entwicklung der Bundesrepublik eingewirkt haben, um ihren Anspruch auf Überwachung in Deutschland und von Deutschland aus dauerhaft zu sichern. Um das zu ermöglichen, wurde 1968 das Grundrecht auf Unverletzlichkeit des Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnis stark eingeschränkt, die Gewaltenteilung aufgehoben und der Rechtsweg ausgeschlossen. So entstand ein gewaltiger deutsch-alliierter geheimdienstlicher Komplex, der sich jeder Kontrolle entzieht. Der Schlüssel zum Verständnis der sechzigjährigen Geschichte der Überwachung liegt in dem strikten Geheimhaltungsgebot, auf das sich beide Seiten immer wieder verpflichteten.\r\n\r\nWelche Konsequenzen hatte das alles für Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Souveränität der zweiten deutschen Republik? Welche Konsequenzen ergeben sich aus den fortgesetzten Angriffen auf die freiheitlich-demokratische Ordnung der Bundesrepublik? Warum schweigt die Bundesregierung zu den elementaren Bedrohungen der verfassungsmäßig garantierten Grundfreiheiten und Grundrechten? Warum arbeitet sie an einem „Anti-Spionage-Abkommen“ und lässt gleichzeitig den Bau eines hochmodernen Spionagezentrums für die amerikanischen Geheimdienste auf deutschem Boden in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim zu? Wie rechtsstaatlich und wie souverän ist das am meisten überwachte Land in Europa?\r\n\r\nIn seinem Vortrag erörtert Josef Foschepoth die historischen Grundlagen und die notwendigen Konsequenzen, die sich aus diesen und vielen anderen Fragen ergeben.","persons":[{"id":4388,"full_public_name":"Josef Foschepoth"}],"links":[]},{"id":5193,"logo":"/system/logos/5193/medium/beans_small_logo.png?1375903502","date":"2013-12-28T17:15:00+01:00","start":"17:15","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5193_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312281715_-_hardware_attacks_advanced_arm_exploitation_and_android_hacking_-_stephen_a_ridley","title":"Hardware Attacks, Advanced ARM Exploitation, and Android Hacking","subtitle":"","track":"Security & Safety","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"In this talk (which in part was delivered at Infiltrate 2013 and NoSuchCon 2013) we will discuss our recent research that is being rolled into our Practical ARM Exploitation course (sold out at Blackhat this year and last) on Linux and Android (for embedded applications and mobile devices).

These schemes often employ cryptographically secure protocols. The weakest link of such a scheme is the chip itself. By attacking the chip directly an attacker can gain access to the secret data in its unencrypted form. In this presentation we demonstrate the attack class of the future, backside attacks. This class of attacks mitigate all device countermeasures and can access all signals of the device. As opposed to the attacks of today, these attacks can also be applied to complex systems such as the ARM SoCs of modern smartphones.","description":"Over recent years hackers and chip manufacturers have been deadlocked in the field of integrated circuit security. From reverse engineering proprietary cryptographic algorithms and microprobing bus lines to fault injection and side cannel attacks, every class of attack has ushered in new preventative countermeasures. Most attacks to date are performed from the frontside where all the active areas and circuit nodes are accesible. Hence, all countermeasures, such as shields and meshes, also  focus on mitigating attacks from the frontside. Security relevant signals are burried under many layers of metalization to make them inaccessible to frontside attackers.\r\nThe direct consequence is that backside attacks become significantly more appealing. With comprably little effort, many old-school attacks are once again possible. Setting or resetting fuses, probing wires or even single transistors is possible, not only with needles but with electron beams or lasers. More exotic attacks are feasible from the backside as well. For example, in switching transistors some of the electrons induce photons that can be seen with an infrared camera during execution. The opposite, i.e. iducing laser light, can also result in successful glitching attacks.\r\nCurrently, there are is little IC vendors can do to prevent such attacks.","persons":[{"id":4224,"full_public_name":"nedos"}],"links":[]},{"id":5604,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-28T23:00:00+01:00","start":"23:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5604_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312282300_-_seeing_the_secret_state_six_landscapes_-_trevor_paglen","title":"Seeing The Secret State: Six Landscapes","subtitle":"","track":"Art & Beauty","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Although people around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the United States' global geography of surveillance, covert action, and other secret programs, much of this landscape is invisible in our everyday lives.","description":" The drone war, for example, seems to happen “somewhere else” while surveillance programs take place among the (largely) invisible infrastructures and digital protocols of the internet and other communications networks.

While such scanning behavior is often associated with botnets and worms, it also has proved to be a powerful methodology for security research.  Recent studies, beginning with the EFF's SSL Observatory, have demonstrated that Internet-wide scanning can help reveal new kinds of vulnerabilities, monitor deployment of mitigations, and shed light on previously opaque distributed ecosystems.  Unfortunately, this methodology has been more accessible to attackers than to researchers without access to botnets or willingness to spread self-replicating code.  Comprehensively scanning the public address space with off-the-shelf tools like Nmap requires weeks of time or many machines.\r\n\r\nTo make Internet-wide scanning more accessible, my research team recently introduced <a href=\"https://zmap.io\">ZMap</a>, an open-source network scanner that is designed from the ground up to perform Internet-scale port scans.  In our tests using a gigabit Ethernet uplink, ZMap scans the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from a single machine, more than 1300 times faster than Nmap.  By the time of the talk, we'll have switched to a 10 gigE uplink, which should theoretically support scanning the entire address space in under 5 minutes.  I'll explain how ZMap's architecture enables such high performance by taking advantage of fast modern hardware and recent improvements to the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nWe'll work through a series of practical examples that explore the security applications of very fast Internet-scale scanning, both offensive and defensive, and I'll share experiences from conducting more than 300 Internet-wide scans over the past 18 months, totaling well over 1 trillion probes.  I'll describe how we completed hundreds of scans targeting every public HTTPS server (each scan larger than the entire SSL Observatory) in order to shed light on the growth of HTTPS deployments and expose security problems within the HTTPS ecosystem, such as misissued CA certs and widespread server misconfiguration.  I'll show how high-speed scanning can be used to expose vulnerable hosts, using IPMI and UPnP vulnerabilities as recent examples.  Malicious attackers could abuse this capability to exploit 0day vulnerabilities affecting millions of hosts within hours of a problem's discovery, and better defenses are badly needed.  Finally, I'll discuss applications to Internet freedom, including discovering unadvertised services such as hidden Tor bridges (used for censorship resistance) and Bluecoat devices (used for state-sponsored censorship).\r\n\r\nHigh-speed scanning can be a powerful tool in the hands of security researchers, but users must be careful not to cause harm by inadvertently overloading networks or causing unnecessary work for network administrators.  I'll discuss the complaints and other reactions my group's scanning has generated--on one occasion we were mistaken for an Iranian DoS attack on U.S. banks, and we received a visit from the FBI--and I'll suggest several guidelines and best practices for good Internet citizenship while scanning.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a unique period in the history of the Internet: widely available networks are becoming fast enough to quickly and exhaustively scan the IPv4 address space, yet IPv6 (with its much larger address space) has not yet been widely deployed.  I hope this talk will help researchers make the most of this window of opportunity. \r\n","persons":[{"id":4228,"full_public_name":"J.

This controller is an attack surface of interest. First, the ability to modify the block allocation and erasure algorithms introduces the opportunity to perform various MITM attacks in a virtually undetectable fashion. Second, the controller itself is typically powerful, with performance around 50MIPS, yet with a cost of mere pennies, making it an interesting and possibly useful development target for other non-storage related purposes. Finally, understanding the inner workings of the controller enables opportunities for data recovery in cards that are thought to have been erased, or have been partially damaged.\r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates a method for reverse engineering and loading code into the microcontroller within a SD memory card.","description":"TECHNICAL APPROACH\r\n\r\nPublicly available documentation on SD card controllers is scarce.  However, based upon tear-down and decap analysis as well as a survey of the publicly available product briefs, most controllers are believed to be either an enhanced 8051, or an ARM derivative.\r\n\r\nA further challenge to overcome is the fact that SD card manufacturers typically reserve the right to change the controller IC within a card without updating the external markings to reflect the change. This policy favors the SD card manufacturers, as it allows them to swap out existing controllers for lower-cost devices as new controllers are introduced. However, it is problematic for users as it means that two otherwise identical looking cards can have different performance and/or bugs with which to contend.\r\n\r\nTo kick off the effort, a survey of available cards was made at an SD card gray market in Shenzhen, China. Each card was dissected and visually inspected for cues, such as the layout of the traces going to the controller glob-top, that would indicate the type of controller within.  About a dozen different controller types were identified, of which one was picked for further investigation due to its use of SLC FLASH memory.  SLC is a good starting point for reverse engineering because no storage-level scrambling is required to prevent the read and write-disturb issues typical of MLC and TLC FLASH.\r\n\r\nA simple binary dump of the FLASH memory within the card revealed structure within the first erase block consistent with what we might expect for code storage. Since FLASH memory is inherently unreliable, four CRC + ECC protected copies of code are located within the first sector. This crude duplication scheme allows the card to boot even if bit errors creep into the code storage sector. We also noted the existence of the string “BUILDWIN” within the code storage sector, which indicates that the controller is likely from a series made by a company called Appotech. Product briefs from the Appotech/Buildwin websites indicated that the architecture of the code is likely an 8051-derivative, and the model of the controller is probably an AX211.\r\n\r\nAt this point, our effort to reverse engineer the controller split into two paths. One path was static analysis, where extracted binaries and manufacturing-related tools were analyzed with IDA to determine key entry points, storage locations, and most importantly a method for injecting code into the card via the SD interface. The other path was dynamic analysis, where the signals going to the SD card bus and to the NAND FLASH were instrumented with logging and stimulus facilities, and the controller's operation could be observed with exquisite resolution, enabling a broad class of fuzzing and other brute-force analysis attacks, as well as the rapid confirmation or rejection of hypotheses generated by static analysis. Dynamic analysis was key in determining features such as the location of the GPIO control registers and the function and format of otherwise undocumented extended instruction opcodes.\r\n\r\nThe static analysis path was assisted by the availability of official firmware burning routines, scavenged from Chinese language file-sharing websites. These are tools normally used during the production of SD cards, but made available on the gray market to enable (and correct) card capacity expansion fraud. Typically, these tools are used to flash an incorrect version of the firmware onto the SD cards, which would identify the card as having a much higher capacity than the physically available storage.  This would allow unscrupulous dealers to sell, for example, aging 128MiB silicon as devices identifying themselves with 2GiB capacity. These bootleg tools would come with a collection of firmware blobs for loading onto the card, as well as a routine that communicates to a proprietary USB-based burning device. We did not have access to the burner, but static analysis of the communication protocol via code reverse engineering revealed that firmware loading is initiated through the application of a specific “secret knock” sequence during card boot.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic analysis path was implemented using an embedded platform of our making, known publicly as Novena. It is a quad-core ARM CPU running Linux mated to a Spartan 6 FPGA with a high speed expansion port. The FPGA also has a 256 MiB DDR3 buffer slaved off of it. This buffer + FPGA was used to implement a combination logic analyzer + ROM emulator used to wrap the controller on the SD card. The ROM emulator presents a virtual, dual-ported NAND FLASH device to the SD card controller. The dual-port design allows us to modify and read the contents of the NAND FLASH on the fly, thereby allowing us to stimulate the controller IC with various fault conditions or code loops and measure its effect on the FLASH device. This tight coupling enabled us to rapidly discover, for example, which SFRs (Special Function Registers) are responsible for reading or writing to the Flash controller hardware. Furthermore, each port of the SD card controller is connected to a virtual logic analyzer within the FPGA that can store up to a 16MiB trace of transactions going to and from the controller from both the SD and FLASH buses. This very deep buffer length allowed us to observe behavior of the device from power-on to full operation, as well as observe stimulus-response loops to compound SD bus commands.\r\n\r\nSD INTERFACE OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the details of our approach, we review a few important aspects of the SD protocol. When an SD card first boots, it is running in SD/MMC mode.  This is a 9-wire protocol, using the following pinout (note: pin 9 is located below and to the side of pin 1):\r\n\r\n 12345678\r\n9|||||||\\- DAT1\r\n|||||||\\-- DAT0\r\n||||||\\--- GND\r\n|||||\\---- Clock\r\n||||\\----- VDD +3.3V\r\n|||\\------ GND\r\n||\\------- Command\r\n|\\-------- DAT3\r\n\\--------- DAT2\r\n\r\nSD commands consist of a start bit of 0, a sync bit of 1, a 6-bit command number (referred to as CMDn, where n is between 0 and 63,) four 8-bit arguments, a CRC7 checksum, and a stop-bit of 1. This yields a total of 48-bits (or 6 bytes) per command.\r\n\r\nWhile the card is processing the request, it will keep the Command line high, and will begin its communication with a start bit by bringing the Command line low, indicating \"0\". This will be followed by 38 bits of data, 7 bits of crc7, and a stop bit of \"1\", for a total of 48 bits.\r\n\r\nBit values are sampled when the clock line is high, and may change when the clock line is low. Bytes are sent from high to low. For example, hex value 0x80 would be written out as 0b10000000. CMD0 must be sent before any other commands are processed. To send such a command, transmit the following six byes.\r\n\r\n{0x40 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x95}\r\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\----- (CRC7 of ({0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}))<<1 | 1\r\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\---------- Four arguments of \"0\"\r\n    \\------------------------------ Start bit of 0, cmd bit of 1, CMD0)\r\n\r\nThen, continue to wiggle the clock, and look for the 48-bit response.  Data is transmitted either on the DAT0 line (for 1-bit mode), or striped in parallel across DAT0-DAT3. As with the Command line, bit 7 is sent first, and bit 0 is sent last. In four-bit mode, DAT3 will send bit 7, DAT2 will send bit 6, DAT1 will send bit 5, and DAT4 will send bit 4.  Bits 3-0 will be sent using DAT3-DAT0 on the next clock cycle.\r\n\r\nData is transmitted with a start bit of 0, followed by the data (almost always 512 bytes), followed by a CRC16 of the data, and then a stop bit of 1. In the case of 4-bit mode, all four DAT lines send a start bit of 0, and each individual line sends its own CRC16 of the transmitted data. All four lines send a stop bit of 1, as well.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER-SPECIFIC NOTES\r\n\r\nThe AX211 is based on the 8051 architecture, which is an eight-bit processor core that is very common among embedded parts. The original 8051 ran at around 1 MIPS, but improvements in architecture and clock speed allows the 8051 present in the AX211 to run at 50 MIPS. The 8051 instruction set had a single undefined opcode of 0xa5, which is used by Appotech to implement 32-bit instruction set extensions. \r\n\r\nThe hardware SD protocol engine only handles transferring bytes (OSI layers 1 & 2). The higher-level details of the SD protocol set is implemented entirely in software, making for a compelling attack surface. When the processor first starts up it attempts to load a valid flash image off of the NAND. While it is in this state, it can respond to a limited set of SD commands, including \"RESET\", \"Set CRC7 required\", and \"Set voltage\". It will not respond to the \"Go Ready\" command until it has loaded its firmware. There are four copies of the AX211 firmware, located at NAND offset 0x0000, 0x10000, 0x20000, and 0x30000. Each copy is protected with its own error correcting code. If all four copies are sufficiently damaged, or if the NAND is missing or blank, then the card will never fully boot, and will never be able to go ready.\r\n\r\nFACTORY PROGRAMMER\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, we had found a copy of the Windows-based AX211 factory programming tool off of Chinese-language file sharing websites. The full AX211 factory programming suite is a combination of this software and a proprietary (and unknown to us) hardware tool. We suspect the hardware is based on the AppoTech AX2002 processor, which also uses an 8051-compatible instruction set. The device connects to the main PC through USB, and has the USB ID string of \"appotechcksd\". This allows the software to identify the programmer regardless of its product/vendor ID. We believe the device may have a small display, or else it prints debugging information out a serial port. The programming software is almost entirely in Chinese. It does not contain a codepage identifier, so a system must be set to run non-Unicode programs as \"Chinese (PRC)\", which selects an encoding of GB-18030. If you do not do this, the software will display gibberish in place of Chinese text.\r\n\r\nThe programmer control software appears to be fully automated. Without the programmer hardware, we can only configure the software and see where, presumably, individual hardware programmers would appear in the user interface. Therefore, we must resort to disassembling the binary to determine how it works. Code flow analysis indicates that when the software initially detects the attachment of factory programming hardware via USB, it opens the device and sends a binary file called \"2005FM.BIN\". 2005FM.BIN is a raw opcode stream that is loaded into the programmer hardware's 8051 (not the SD target) at address 0. The program begins running from address 0, and begins doing some initialization. It then displays the string \"RUN\" through the putative logging interface on the programming hardware. After this, it awaits further control instructions from the host.\r\n\r\nThe microcontroller used in the programmer hardware does not contain an SD/MMC host controller. This is fortunate for us, as it means the SD programming interface is implemented entirely using GPIOs. This makes it easy to trace all signal changes through static code analysis.\r\n\r\nWhen programming begins, the programmer places the SD card into a special mode where it will accept and execute programs. It does this by sending SD CMD0 (card reset) followed within 20 msec by CMD63 with the arguments 'A' 'P' 'P' 'O' and the appropriate crc7 checksum. The card then responds with the following sequence:\r\n\r\n{0x3f 0x00 0x9d 0x20 0x0b 0x35}\r\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\-- CRC7 checksum, plus stop bit\r\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\------- Unknown values\r\n    \\---------------------------- The command we sent (CMD63)\r\n\r\nThe program to be executed on the SD card is then loaded to offset 0x2900, and will begin executing immediately from within an interrupt context. Therefore, the first thing the routine should do is escape the context by changing the return value, then issuing a \"reti\" command.\r\n\r\nWhen the host software detects a new card to be programmed, it informs the programmer to put the card into this special factory mode, and then begins uploading firmware and communicating with the card. The first program to get loaded is a small piece of test code called TestBoot.bin.  The program performs a few sanity checks, then returns pass or fail by sending the result out the Command line. Once the program finishes, control returns to the AX211 ROM.\r\n\r\nAfter TestBoot.bin runs, the programmer loads a file called communication.bin. This program contains a full interrupt vector table, and is therefore able to replace functions such as SD communication and NAND access. It uses this to load a new, expanded set of communication options, including the ability to load and execute another program at memory offset 0x800. Because it has its own interrupt vector table, it loads at offset 0, and takes control of the entire card.\r\n\r\nOnce the communications program is loaded, the programmer uses it to load more advanced programs that actually deal with the NAND flash component. Programs are loaded at offset 0x800 in order to allow the communications program (and its interrupt vector table) to stay resident.\r\n\r\nThe first program loaded is FLASH_SCAN.BIN, which is responsible for scanning the flash to determine its properties. This can be useful when operators are not familiar with the type of NAND they're working with.  This program is able to inform the host of properties such as the page size, flash size, and ECC data. The host can then use this information to construct a Card ID block.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the host controller can choose to ignore the information coming from the flash, and can program invalid flash sizes.  This can occur either deliberately or accidentally. Thus, some \"counterfeit\" cards may simply be a result of an operator forgetting to change the settings when programming a new batch of NAND.\r\n\r\nAfter the flash has been scanned, a program called FLASH_PRO.BIN is loaded. This is responsible for the actual programming of the NAND with the requisite firmware file. With FLASH_PRO.BIN running, the programmer must feed the card a firmware file. A wide variety of firmwares are bundled with the programming software, and vary between the vendor, page size, block size, number of planes, and the number of chip enables. The host picks an appropriate firmware file to send, and writes it out to the card.\r\n\r\nAfter programming is complete, the programmer resets the card and formats it. Depending on the size of the card, the programmer places either a FAT16 or a FAT32 header on the card, and creates the actual file allocation table. It is interesting to note that there are two DOS MBRs stored in the 2005FM.BIN programmer firmware, complete with an NTLDR boot sector. This gets placed at the head of the card, with the actual file allocation table following shortly after.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of reversing the factory programmer binaries is the development of our own routines which is capable of knocking the AX211 and loading our own code onto the device.\r\n\r\nAX211 FIRMWARE REVERSING\r\n\r\nThe contents of the programs run on the AX211 has also been analyzed. In addition to confirming the host-side initialization protocols documented above, the firmware reversing effort has revealed more details on the allocation of instruction set enhancements and the Function Specific Registers (FSRs). FSRs are memory-mapped registers that are used to control and configure the state of the hardware. For example, the pins required to turn NAND I/Os into GPIOs and toggle their values is contained in the FSR region; therefore discovering the FSR map is an important component of achieving maximum utility from the SD card controller.\r\n\r\nOpcode extensions on the 8051 are accomplished by using the escape opcode 0xA5. This is the only opcode function in the 8051 which doesn't have a pre-defined value. Typically, the escape opcode is followed by one or more bytes that specify which escape sequence to use. In our investigation of the firmware, we have only seen one and two-byte escape sequences. Two-byte sequences require that the lower nibble of the first escape opcode to be 1's. We have modified the 8051 processor module in IDA to handle these escape sequences gracefully. Our current theory is that the opcode extensions are used to trigger various NAND interface functions, such as transmitting a command cycle or computing ECC on a loaded page of memory. \r\n\r\nThe FSR map was determined in part through static binary code analysis in IDA, and in part through a dynamic fuzzing infrastructure. For example, to determine which FSR was used as a GPIO, we wrote a small assembly stub that would set a pseudo-random (based upon a seed value, so we could reproduce experiments later on) selection of four FSR registers within the 128-byte window of valid FSRs to 0xFF, then 0x00, with a few microseconds' delay between. We had connected an oscilloscope to one of the NAND I/Os on the AX211, and monitored for changes in I/O status while running this code. We decided to write four bytes at once under the theory that we had to configure not only a data register, but also direction & configuration registers as well to be outputs for us to measure a change using the oscilloscope. With some luck, we were able to discover very quickly an FSR which, when written to, would cause some of the NAND I/O pins to flip on and off.\r\n\r\nThrough this combination of static and dynamic analysis, we have confirmed the function of much of the FSR table, which looks like this: \r\n\r\n     |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |\r\n     |   8   |   9   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |   F   |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 80  | SDMOD |  SP   |  DPL  |  DPH  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 88  | SDOS  | SDI4  | SDI3  | SDI2  | SDI1  | SDCMD | IACK  |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 90  | SDSM  |       |       | SDBL  | SDBH  |       | SDDL  | SDDH  |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n 98  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n A0  | NTYPE | NCMD  | NRAML | NRAMH |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n A8  |  IE   | NCMD1 | NCMD2 | NADD0 | NADD1 | NADD2 | NADD3 | NADD4 |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n B0  |       | RAND  |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n B8  | ER8   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n C0  | ER00  | ER01  | ER02  | ER03  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n C8  | ER10  | ER11  | ER12  | ER13  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n D0  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n D8  | ER20  | ER21  | ER22  | ER23  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n E0  | ACC   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n E8  |       |       | NFMT  | SDDIR |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n F0  | B     |       | NPRE1 | NPRE2 |       |       | PORT1 |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n F8  | ER30  | ER31  | ER32  | ER33  |       |       |       |       |\r\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nOur presumption is many of the spots reading back as 00 are probably unused FSRs, so we have probably uncovered the function of most of the implemented FSRs.\r\n\r\nWORKING IT: A REPL DEBUGGER\r\n\r\nIn investigating the actual runtime firmware of the AX211 card, it has become apparent that the entire SD engine at the protocol level is implemented in 8051 code. Only the SD physical layer (including both SPI and MMC mode) is handled in hardware. When the host controller sends a command such as CMD0, the host controller actually treats the command as an offset in a jump table. Application commands are also treated in a separate jump table. This means that it is a trivial matter to add an additional command. All one needs to do is co-opt one of the unused commands, which currently point to a default handler. There is plenty of space at the end of the firmware to add any additional commands.\r\n\r\nNow that the SD controller's functions are well known, we were able to implement a REPL-mode debugger firmware for the SD controller:\r\n\r\nroot@bunnie-novena:~/ax211-code# ./ax211 -d debugger.bin\r\nFPGA hardware v1.26\r\nDebug mode APPO response [6]: {0x3f 0x00 0xc1 0x04 0x17 0xab}\r\nResult of factory mode: 0\r\n00000000 0f 41 1f 0f 0f 0f ff ff |.A......|\r\nExpected 0x00 0x00, got 0x0f 0x41\r\nLoaded debugger\r\nLocating fixup hooks...

Therefore, in order to implement a rich command feature set, the debugger functions are partitioned between a host CPU (the ARM i.MX6) and the target 8051-based CPU. For example, disassembling a particular region of memory breaks down to a script executed on the host side that drives the native AX211 stub code to dump the requested portion of memory to disassemble, followed up with the disassembly algorithm running on the host ARM CPU.\r\n\r\nThe only way to talk to the AX211 is via the SD interface. Therefore, the interactive REPL environment must run on the host ARM system, which is equipped with the requisite terminal interface features such as a ssh console. The REPL environment then translates the user's requests into bundles of SD commands. We take advantage of the command/response token protocol built into the SD-PHY spec (see page 8 of SD Card Physical Layer Simplified Specification v2.00 for more information). The command/response protocol runs bidirectionally on a single wire, the CMD line of the SD-PHY interface, and is timed by the CLK line. Command tokens are 48-bits long, and contain a CRC along with some static header bits. Response tokens are also 48 bits long, and similarly feature CRC protection along with different static header bits. The SD commands originating from the REPL environment are transmitted to the AX211 via the FPGA built into the host system. The FPGA presents a “gpio-like” API for the SD host PHY: one register for data output, one register for data input, and one register to bit-wise set the data direction. \r\n\r\nThe SD commands are received on the AX211 and processed by the hardware SD engine attached to the embedded 8051 CPU. The state machine handles receiving the data and computing/checking the CRC.  Once a complete packet is received by the state machine, the 8051 is notified of the packet's arrival via an interrupt.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the 512 bytes of native 8051 code for our debugger contains the following routines:\r\n\r\n* An entry sequence that resets the execution environment and redirects ongoing code execution into the debug.bin patch\r\n* An interrupt handler for receiving SD command packets\r\n* Code to set the ISR handler to our new interrupt handler\r\n* A jump table to parse incoming SD commands\r\n* Helper routines, such as the response transmission and wait loops\r\n* Implementation of all the basic stub commands:\r\n  * hello - inform the host we're running\r\n  * echo - loop back the request\r\n  * peek - request contents of XRAM\r\n  * poke - set contents of XRAM\r\n  * jump - run code at an address\r\n  * nand - manipulate the NAND hardware registers\r\n  * SFR/IRAM get/set routines - more on this below\r\n  * extended opcode - execute an extended opcode\r\n  * error - return an error code\r\n\r\nCROSS-MEMORY AREA ACCESS\r\n\r\nThe 8051 has two different kinds of memory, each of which is further subdivided:\r\n\r\nIRAM - located on-chip. 256 bytes in total. Accessed using \"mov\" instruction. The IRAM map is as follows:\r\n  * IRAM address 0-7 corresponds to CPU registers R0-R7\r\n  * IRAM address 8-0x7f are on-chip RAM\r\n  * IRAM address 0x80-0xff are Special Function Registers (SFRs). SFRs are locations that are mapped to hardware functions, such as the NAND command engine or GPIO\r\n\r\nXRAM - 16 kilobytes of \"External\" RAM (this memory was a physically separate chip in the original non-embedded 8051 implementation). Accessed by storing an address in DPTR (which is really made up of SFR 0x82 and 0x83, called DPL and DPH respectively) and either loading to the accumulator using \"movx A, @DPTR\" or storing from the accumulator using \"movx @DPTR, A\". The XRAM map is as follows:\r\n  * 0x0000 - 0x0006 is reserved. Contains 0x51 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...\r\n  * 0x0007 - 0x01ff is protected and returns 0xff. The CPU and NAND block can't read this range, but the SD block can.\r\n  * 0x0200 - 0x0202 is interrupt vector 0 (SPI)\r\n  * 0x0203 - 0x0205 is interrupt vector 1 (other SPI)\r\n  * 0x0206 - 0x0208 is interrupt vector 2 (NAND)\r\n  * 0x0209 - 0x020b is interrupt vector 3 (unknown)\r\n  * 0x020c - 0x02af is general-purpose RAM\r\n  * Code execution for APPO factory mode begins at offset 0x2900\r\n  * 0x2ba0 - 0x2bff contains something interesting, and I'm not sure what\r\n  * 0x2c00 - 0x3fff is read-only and contains zeroes\r\n  * 0x0000 - 0x3fff is mirrored at 0x4000, 0x8000, and 0xc000\r\n\r\nThe division of 8051 memory space into IRAM and XRAM presents a unique challenge for debugger implementation.  Not being able to index into IRAM means that one cannot dereference a variable pointer into IRAM. In the 8051 ISA, only constant values can be dereferenced into IRAM. This pseudo code draws a loose analogy of the situation in C-like syntax:\r\n\r\niram_vaule = *iram_pointer; // ERROR: variable values not allowed\r\niram_value = *(0x42); // ACCEPTABLE: only hard-coded constant values allowed\r\n\r\nThis limitation of the 8051 architecture present a challenge in implementing a key feature of the debugger, namely enabling the dynamic exploration of the IRAM and associated SFR space.  \r\n\r\nFortunately, on the AX211, the debugger code is loaded into XRAM, which can be indexed via the DPTR register using the MOVX instruction. This allows the debugger to manipulate its own code, thereby allowing us to change, for example, the offset constant to a MOV instruction inside the debugger.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to implement peek and poke in the IRAM space (and likewise enable convenient exploration of the SFRs), we reserve three-byte slots in debug.bin using a sentinel sequence of invalid opcodes that are unique and searchable.  \r\n\r\nOnce debug.bin is loaded, one of the first tasks the host program does is scan the loaded program for the unique sequences and records their offsets. These sequences are then replaced on-demand with the appropriate instructions to implement the required MOV opcodes to explore arbitrary locations in IRAM.  \r\n\r\nBelow is a concrete example of this technique as implemented in the debugger. The following code snippet is from debugger.asm:\r\n\r\ncmd_sfr_get:\r\n  ; This will get replaced by \"mov 0x20, [SFR]\" at runtime\r\n  .db 0xa5, 0x60, 0x61\r\n  mov 0x21, #0\r\n  mov 0x22, #0\r\n  mov 0x23, #0\r\n  sjmp xmit_response\r\n\r\nHere, we are looking at the “SFR get” stub. The arguments to return to the host are loaded into IRAM locations 0x20-0x23. For example,\r\n\r\n  mov 0x21, #0\r\n\r\nputs the constant value 0 into IRAM 0x21; so in this stub, locations 0x21-0x23 are set to 0, and 0x20 is intended to have the value of the queried SFR. \r\n\r\nA sequence of three bytes, “0xA5 0x60 0x61” is used as a placeholder for a different “mov” instruction that will be slotted in. 0xA5 is the sole invalid opcode in the 8051 instruction set, and therefore it is an “almost safe” opcode (bar collisions with other opcode extensions) to use as the starting marker for a sentinel sequence. The remaining bytes “0x60 0x61” are simply chosen to be unique and non-colliding with other opcode extensions.  \r\n\r\nWhen the user requests the value of an SFR via the REPL interface on the host by typing, for example,\r\n\r\n  sfr -r 0xA0\r\n\r\nthe host issues a command to poke the cached location of the sentinel sequence “0xA5 0x60 0x61” with the sequence “0x85 0x20 0xA0” which represents the instruction\r\n\r\n  mov 0x20 0xA0\r\n\r\nRecall that the only difference between IRAM and SFR is that SFRs have an address greater than 0x80; and furthermore all arguments to the mov are constant, therefore this is a valid 8051 instruction that implements the requested command via the REPL interface.  \r\n\r\nNow that the correct instruction has been installed in the cmd_sfr_get routine, the actual command to run this callback is issued on the SD interface and the requested SFR is returned to the host. This enhanced ability to interrogate the SFR space dynamically allowed us to greatly expand our map of the special function registers.\r\n\r\nEXTENDED OPCODES\r\n\r\nA similar method was used to also explore the extended opcode space for the 8051. As noted in the previous section, “0xA5” is the sole illegal instruction in the native 8051 instruction set, and in enhancements such as the one found in the AX211, it is used as an escape sequence to specify an extended instruction set.  \r\n\r\nAs a (entertaining) side-note, the sparse literature available on the AX211 claims that the on-board 8051 is a 32-bit processor. We originally thought this was an amusing “lost in translation” moment, but in fact, the AX211 implements a set of instructions that operate on 32-bit data types using extended opcodes, thereby lending credibility to the “32-bit” label.  \r\n\r\nSFR locations 0xC0-3, 0xC8-B, 0xD8-B, and 0xF8-B were identified as functioning 32-bit registers, and opcodes were discovered that could reverse the order of bits in these registers, invert the contents of these registers, and clear the contents of these registers to zero. There may be other opcodes present as well; code has been found implementing CRC16 checksums using these 32-bit enhancements, and most likely these enhancements also enable the implementation of MLC/TLC scrambling algorithms. The BCH ECC computations, however, are handled by a dedicated hardware coprocessor.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nAn approach has been disclosed for the exploration and exploitation of the embedded controller found within a particular type of SD card. The approach consists of a combination of static code analysis, and dynamic fuzzing analysis. A \"secret knock\" for uploading code into the controller was found, and through this mechanism we explored the register map and extended opcodes of the microcontroller. Significantly, in this particular device all of the SD protocol-layer commands are implemented in software. This allowed us to redefine the SD protocol set and implement, as a demonstration, a REPL-mode debugger for the SD card.","persons":[{"id":3155,"full_public_name":"bunnie"},{"id":4376,"full_public_name":"Xobs"}],"links":[]},{"id":5192,"logo":"/system/logos/5192/medium/Studio_table.png?1375899727","date":"2013-12-29T16:00:00+01:00","start":"16:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5192_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312291600_-_android_ddi_-_collin_mulliner","title":"Android DDI","subtitle":"Dynamic Dalvik Instrumentation of Android Applications and the Android Framework","track":"Security & Safety","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"As application security becomes more important on Android we need better tools to analyze and understand them.

The malware is capable of gathering valuable information such as passwords. Because the infected hardware can perform arbitrary main memory accesses, the malware can modify kernel data structures and escalate privileges of processes executed on the system.\r\n\r\nThe malware itself is a DMA malware implementation referred to as DAGGER. DAGGER exploits Intel’s Manageability Engine (ME), that executes firmware code such as Intel’s Active Management Technology (iAMT), as well as its OOB network channel. We have recently improved DAGGER’s capabilites to include support for 64-bit operating systems and a stealthy update mechanism to download new attack code.","description":"Dedicated hardware such as network interface cards and video controllers can be exploited to conduct a direct memory access (DMA) attack. Direct access means main memory access without the involvement of the host CPU, which in turn means that existing host security software cannot detect or prevent the attack.\r\n\r\nOur presentation covers a DMA malware that benefits from an isolated network channel to update the attack code and to exfiltrate captured data. To be more precise, we show how to conduct a DMA attack using Intel's Manageability Engine (ME). Our attack environment is dedicated hardware based on a 32-bit RISC processor called ARCtangent-A4 (ARC4, x86-incompatible) implemented in the chipset of modern Intel platforms. Intel's ME executes special firmware such as Intel's Active Management Technology (iAMT). The ME/iAMT environment provides an administrator with an Out-of-Band (OOB) network channel to maintain the computer platform remotely. A prominent iAMT feature is the capability to remotely reinstall an operating system that got corrupted and does not boot anymore. iAMT is also available when the platform is in a standby or powered off state. This can be exploited to implement persistent DMA malware. It is needless to say that such a powerful environment must be well protected. Hence, Intel enforces strong isolation of the ME execution environment that makes it perfect to hide malware. The ME is not only implemented in business platforms, but also in consumer platforms.\r\n\r\nOur work does not only show, that an arbitrary attacker is able to perform one of the most dangerous attacks against an iAMT featured platform, but also, that the ME provides a perfect environment for undetectable sensitive data leakage on behalf of the attacker. Our presentation consists of three parts. The first part addresses how to find valuable data in the main memory of the host. The second part exploits the ME's OOB network channel to exfiltrate captured data to an external platform and to inject new attack code to target other interesting data structures available in the host runtime memory. The last part deals with the implementation of a covert network channel based on JitterBug.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of our presentation we exploit the DMA engine of Intel's ME to find valuable data in the host runtime memory. We have two memory targets. Our first target is the keyboard buffer. We demonstrate how to find the buffer on a Linux as well as on a Windows operating system. Our implementation is called DAGGER - DmA based keyloGGER. We implemented different search strategies for the operating system targets. On Windows we need to find the corresponding CR3 processor register value to get the page directory entries that are needed to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones. We also had to take address randomization into account. The search strategy for the Windows keyboard buffer is mainly based on finding and traversing the so called Object Manager Namespace Directory (OMND). On Linux we implemented a different search strategy. On Linux we have a different starting point for the search phase than on Windows. The implementation to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones is also different. On Linux we can go without page tables. Due to the availability of the Linux source code it was easier to derive a signature for our target structure used by the USB HID driver. \r\n\r\nWe can permanently monitor the keyboard buffer on both operating system targets. Hence, we can capture all user input (passwords, instant messenger sessions, etc.) done via the associated keyboard. Our second memory target concerns the privilege data of an arbitrary process. Again, we use the DMA engine of the ME to find the appropriate data structure. Then we overwrite the existing privileges with root privileges via DMA.\r\n\r\nThe privilege escalation attack actually belongs to the second part of our attack scenario. The implementation is based on an updated version of DAGGER that is able to attack 64-bit operation systems. We demonstrate how to remotely load new attack code (to escalate privileges) to be executed on Intel's ME using the isolated OOB channel. To figure out how to exploit the DMA engine to read from the host runtime memory was comparatively easy due to previous work. To figure out how to exploit the ME OOB feature was more challenging. We had to find the ring buffers that iAMT uses to send and receive network packets and the corresponding ring buffer pointers. We also had to find code that is responsible for sending data to an external platform in the 16MB iAMT firmware runtime memory. To get the OOB channel under our control we implemented a breakpoint helper tool. That tool disassembles and displays iAMT code present in the iAMT runtime memory on-the-fly. This enables us to set breakpoints (based on hooks) to check the register content of the ARC4 processor. We were able to identify all necessary OOB channel parts by setting breakpoints and by triggering network events.\r\n\r\nThe last part of our presentation deals with a covert network channel based on JitterBug. The OOB channel is perfect to hide malicious network packets from the host, but not from other monitors present in the network. The aim of the JitterBug based covert network channel is to demonstrate how far an attacker can go with stealthy data exfiltration when using Intel's ME as attack environment. Using the JitterBug technique the attacker exfiltrates information by introducing seemingly random delays to some outgoing network packets. The delay pattern can be decoded by an external platform that is under the control of the attacker. Since timing is very important to implement a JitterBug, we had to figure out how to exactly measure time in the ME execution environment. Furthermore, we had to determine which network packets are \"delayable\" and how to delay them. To learn how to use the required ME/iAMT components for a JitterBug implementation we developed a more advanced debug tool. This debug tool is based on ARC4 code emulation and it enabled us to collect a huge amount of firmware trace logs that eventually revealed the required parts of the ME/iAMT inner workings. \r\n\r\nIn our talk we will present important runtime memory areas and ARC4 disassemblies of the ARC4 based code. Furthermore, we will present demo videos of our attack scenarios. Please note, we do not present a new security vulnerability to exploit Intel's ME.","persons":[{"id":4173,"full_public_name":"Patrick Stewin"}],"links":[]},{"id":5538,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-29T20:30:00+01:00","start":"20:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 2","slug":"30C3_-_5538_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201312292030_-_the_internet_doesn_t_need_another_security_guide_-_evacide","title":"The Internet (Doesn't) Need Another Security Guide","subtitle":"Creating Internet Privacy and Security Resources That Don't Suck","track":"Science & Engineering","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"As Internet privacy/security professionals and amateur enthusiasts, we are often asked to give advice about best practices in this field.

While most video game consoles use controllers that are very basic, the Wii U took the opposite route with a very featureful gamepad: wireless with a fairly high range, touch screen, speakers, accelerometer, video camera, and even NFC are supported by the Wii U gamepad. However, as of today, this interesting piece of hardware can only be used in conjunction with a Wii U: wireless communications are encrypted and obfuscated, and there is no documentation about the protocols used for data exchange between the console and its controller. Around december 2012, I started working with two other hackers in order to reverse engineer, document and implement the Wii U gamepad communication protocols on a PC. This talk will present our findings and show the current state of our reverse engineering efforts.","description":"When the Wii U was released, a few console hackers and I were talking about potential uses for the Wii U gamepad. However, before being able to use a Wii U gamepad as a remote controller for a robot or a quadricopter, the first step was to understand how it worked and how to communicate with it. This started our long journey of soldering wires on Flash chips, reading the h.264 specification and complaining about the lack of features in most Wi-Fi drivers and devices (on all platforms, Linux and ath9k devices being the least horrible).\r\n\r\nWhile some “journalists” reported that the Wii U gamepad is using the Miracast™ technology, a Wi-Fi standard, it turned out that this was never the case. Instead, Nintendo decided to reinvent four different protocols (video streaming, audio streaming, input streaming as well as a light request-reply RPC protocol), and embed them in a slightly obfuscated version of WPA2, sent over the air using 5GHz Wi-Fi 802.11n. A small ARM CPU is embedded in the Wii U Gamepad (codenamed DRC) and runs a realtime operating system to handle network communication. In the Wii U, another ARM CPU (codenamed DRH) does the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will go into the details of how we went from a 32MB binary blob to a proof of concept of Wii U gamepad “emulation” on a PC, including full documentation of the wireless communications obfuscation layer and partial documentation of the four data exchange protocols used on the gamepad.","persons":[{"id":4080,"full_public_name":"delroth"},{"id":4072,"full_public_name":"shuffle2"}],"links":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt2-IRiWd40","title":"WiiU Gamepad emulation on a PC"}]},{"id":5478,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-29T21:45:00+01:00","start":"21:45","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal G","slug":"30C3_-_5478_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312292145_-_backdoors_government_hacking_and_the_next_crypto_wars_-_christopher_soghoian","title":"Backdoors, Government Hacking and The Next Crypto Wars","subtitle":"","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Law enforcement agencies claim they are \"going dark\".

Bekannt wurden insbesondere Tötungseinsätze britischer und US-amerikanischer ferngesteuerter Kampfdrohnen der Typen Predator und Reaper, welche vor allem mit Hellfire-Raketen (Luft-Boden-Raketen) Bodenziele beschießen. Diese Einsätze (derzeit vor allem in Pakistan und Afghanistan, Somalia und Jemen) sind zu einer wesentlichen Ausformung des weltweiten „Krieges gegen den Terror“ geworden – wenn nicht sogar zu dessen prägnantester Erscheinungsform überhaupt – und dienen der Tötung von vermuteten Mitgliedern terroristischer Gruppen. Doch diese Form der „Jagd auf Terroristen“ ist alles andere als präzise und sauber, denn bei den Explosionen, mit denen die Terror-Verdächtigen hingerichtet werden, sterben auch immer wieder viele Unbeteiligte bzw. Zivilisten, z. B. durch den Beschuss von Wohngebäuden oder anderen zivilen Zielen.\r\n\r\nDie rechtlichen und politischen Probleme dieser Form der Kriegsführung sind schwerwiegend und vielfältig, schließlich handelt es sich um eine Form außergerichtlicher staatlicher Hinrichtung, um Tötungen auf Verdachtsgrundlage und um einen verdeckten, weltweiten “schmutzigen” Krieg. Gefahren liegen in der rasanten Eskalationsdynamik, welche die Drohnenkriege mit sich bringen: Die Welt steht am Beginn eines neuen Wettrüstens.

In our “i3 Berlin” 3d printer project, we took some elements of the PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) concept and implemented it with open source tools like Github and Blender. ","description":"<h3> Common project structure used in the product industry </h3>\r\n\r\n<p> The concept of Product Lifecycle Management is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its conception, through design and manufacture, to service and disposal. PLM is about how to handle versions, communication with users, etc. Every PLM has to be tailor made to the project and the team working on it. PLM is vital to organize open hardware projects to be more focused and efficient, yet being open and adaptive at the same time. Building a PLM is time demanding but will make your projects more and more efficient. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Our experiences so far </h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Our project is the i3 Berlin 3D printer, a remix of the Prusa i3. \r\n- It is an electromechanical project that is mainly built from printed parts and standardized sourced parts.\r\n- We don´t develop electronics, but we do design mechanical parts and make adjustments to the firmware.\r\n- We also sell our design as a kit, which need a manual and a bill of materials that is always up to date. - Furthermore we have to track issues and we want to be open for cooperation by other people. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> We used Blender to design the entire machine. \r\n- Blender is a 3D mesh modeler, where the industry uses solely parametric CAD software when it comes to electromechanical engineering.\r\n- Parametric 3D models are smart, where mesh models are stupid models you modify with smart tools. \r\n- Mesh modeling is a very suitable method, when 3D printing is the main manufacturing method. Design files are much easier to share among people and programs.\r\n- Cables are an intricate part of a moving machine which can be modeled well within Blender. \r\n- We wrote a plug in to generate a bill of material and developed a method to make a step by step visual manual with animation frames. Both BOM and manual are a part of the design file and therefore these will always be up to date. The rendered pictures from Blenders </p>\r\n\r\n<p> For communication we use Github. \r\n- The core ideas and design requirements grow over time in the wiki. \r\n- The submit structure of Github automatically takes care for a version control.\r\n- Git issues work as a support ticket system to track and solve problems. \r\n- Design guidelines make sure that everyone cooperating organizes their work coherently with the project. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Future plans </h3>\r\n\r\n<p> - make Blender more accessible by making tutorials directly focused on mechanical design. \r\n- connect the BOM with a database for logistics and price calculations and demand estimation,\r\n  supply chain\r\n- continue work on OHM (open hardware management) toolbox </p>\r\n","persons":[{"id":4331,"full_public_name":"Bram de Vries"},{"id":4332,"full_public_name":"Morris Winkler"}],"links":[{"url":"https://github.com/open3dengineering/i3_Berlin","title":"i3 Berlin Github"}]},{"id":5420,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-29T13:45:00+01:00","start":"13:45","duration":"00:30","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5420_-_de_-_saal_6_-_201312291345_-_calc_pw_-_kenneth_newwood","title":"calc.pw","subtitle":"Passwortgenerierung mit Arduino  [Generating passwords with Arduino]","track":"Hardware & Making","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Bei calc.pw handelt es sich um DIY Hardware, mit deren Hilfe man Passwörter aus einem Masterpasswort und einfach merkbaren Informationen (z.

Interfaces like mice, keyboards or microphones essentially link the user's body parts to a computer. When creating new content, these interfaces prove to be relatively inefficient, inaccurate and limited by the user's skill.\r\nA good brain-computer-interface would take body movements out of the process. Less required skill and more information flow density are only the most obvious benefits. It is a potential replacement for dozens of today's specialized devices. And, just as a microphone does for voice, it would also allow the transfer of visual imaginations.\r\n\r\nBefore we explain how to create the most advanced brain-computer-interface possible today, Dominic dives quite deeply into the signal processing structure in the brain. He presents the most recent findings in cognitive science and explains what happens - step for step - when we imagine the image of a red ball. At the end of this first section, he arrives at the level of electrical signals.\r\n\r\nAnne then takes over with the groundwork necessary to capture and process these electrical signals. She isn't afraid to use proper math for a deeper understanding, but she made sure that her talk is easy to follow for non-tech majors too. The foundation for a contemporary brain-computer-interface consists of several core algorithms, which are used in lab settings today and by enthusiasts tomorrow. She calls out the pitfalls when dealing with signals from live brains, and covers the technical limitations with crunching the data.\r\n\r\nWe finish with a real-world perspective.

Existing methods are inadequate to fully protect users, particularly from covert physical hardware modifications in the \"evil maid\" scenario, and yet are very inconvenient. Victims include governments and corporations traveling internationally (e.g. China), anti-government activists in places like Syria, and anyone who is a target of a motivated attacker who can gain physical access.\r\n\r\nPhysically Unclonable Functions, combined with a trusted mobile device and a network service, can be used to mitigate these risks. We present a novel open-source mobile client and network service which can protect arbitrary hardware from many forms of covert modification and attack, and which when integrated with software, firmware, and policy defenses, can provide greater protection to users and limit potential attack surface. We'll also be showing video of an unreleased tool to the public utilized by surveillance teams.","description":"Additional Notes for our talk:\r\n\r\n1) The attack addressed is an entire class of hardware, firmware, and software attacks around the attacker gaining surreptitious access and modification (of hardware/firmware/software) on one or more occasions, followed by the authorized user making normal use of the device after these modifications.\r\n\r\nA software-only attack can be addressed through \"trusted boot\" or \"measured boot\" systems (e.g. what TCG does). Firmware attacks are generally not addressed by most measured boot processes, but that's just an implementation problem. The most novel category of attack is defeating the addition of hardware components or modification of hardware components, which becomes a desirable attack once software/firmware are locked down.\r\n\r\nOne scenario is that an investor flies to China with a laptop and a cellphone and intends to remain in the country for several weeks, conducting business online as well as in person. On several occasions, the investor leaves his laptop in his hotel room, while taking his cellphone with him at all times. Adversary agents, as hotel staff, enter the room and make modifications to hardware, with the intent of circumventing either local software protections (cloning drives, capturing pass phrases, etc.) or subverting network resources later accessed, either while the investor remains in China or after he returns to the home office with the laptop.\r\n\r\nIn-depth physical analysis of the hardware, conducted at home base, can often discover hardware modifications. Best current practice is to quarantine \"travel\" machines and never allow them back on high security networks. Unfortunately, this leaves the user exposed for the entire duration of a single trip -- in some situations the entire transaction happens during a trip, so all sensitive information must be protected for that trip.\r\n\r\nPUFs and our network verification can be used to effectively \"sign\" hardware in the field in a way which can be automatically verified and verified interactively with a \"home base\" network service. This lets network resources be protected continuously; before every access, the client device's integrity can be checked and attested.\r\n\r\nAn interesting strategy is to not travel with any sensitive hardware (beyond the cellphone) and buy random laptops at the destination, enroll them in the service while at the destination, provision them with services, and ensure no subsequent unauthorized hardware/firmware/software changes can be made, using the same system.\r\n\r\n2) PUFs\r\n\r\nThe PUFs are functions which can't be (tractably) cloned. Unfortunately, virtually none of these can be inspected/verified/attested directly by an unaided human -- anything which is a simple serial number seal or other human-verifiable thing can be fairly trivially counterfeited.\r\n\r\nThe PUFs make use of large amounts of random and changing data, created through physically random processes which are impossible to (tractably) reproduce. The innovation is to use a user's cellphone and a network service as the verifier -- the phone can remain in the user's physical custody at all times, and by splitting the verification between the phone (on site with the user) and a network service acting as gatekeeper to protected network resources, the system can be protected from various attacks.\r\n\r\nThe PUFS that we take advatage of are that of the physical systems themselves. When a device is created during manufacture a multitude of processes are utilized to produce the compute device. As it turns out reproducibility on the sub millimetre scale of a identical compenents such as a laptop case is excessively difficult to clone/counterfit/interact with without disturbing the previous state. We take advantage of these flaws to aid the user in detecting modification to their computing devices through photography and other standard low cost tamper evidencing devices which a untrained user can deploy in the field.\r\n\r\nClear technical documentation w/ photos explaining why it is incredibly difficult with current attack methods to perfectly clone manufactured parts which on the surface are indistinguishable from another manufactured assembly.","persons":[{"id":4342,"full_public_name":"Eric Michaud"},{"id":4190,"full_public_name":"Ryan Lackey"}],"links":[]},{"id":5255,"logo":"/system/logos/5255/medium/prism.jpg?1386468620","date":"2013-12-30T14:00:00+01:00","start":"14:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 1","slug":"30C3_-_5255_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312301400_-_through_a_prism_darkly_-_kurt_opsahl","title":"Through a PRISM, Darkly","subtitle":"Everything we know about NSA spying","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"From Stellar Wind to PRISM, Boundless Informant to EvilOlive, the NSA spying programs are shrouded in secrecy and rubber-stamped by secret opinions from a court that meets in a faraday cage.

But how do we do it? This talk will outline a framework for a user-focused approach to the Development and Impact of Internet Freedom Tools through using ethnography, human-centered design, and the practice of research-based product definition. This talk is intended for developers, researchers, and journalists who seek to understand how better tools can be developed to protect anonymity and provide unfettered access to the Internet.","description":"Internet Freedom Tools (IFTs) are developed to solve the technical challenges of anonymity, privacy, security and information access. Focus on these technical challenges rather than the user of an IFT can lead to overlooking the motivations, needs and usability issues faced by user communities. Further, IFTs may solve a technical challenge for users, and yet fall short when it comes to user experience. There is a disconnect that must be remedied for IFTs and the people who use them to realize their full potential. This talk seeks to provide new insights to developers and users in need of knowledge on how they can better address relevant problems, create appropriate solutions and help users with IFTs.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain to the audience what tools are available for user-focused design. It will also walk through a framework to guide the development of IFTs that is grounded in ethnographic methods and human-centered design, and how this framework is being used to conduct an IFT user community.\r\n\r\nThis work is currently being conducted by SecondMuse and Radio Free Asia through the Open Technology Fund (www.opentechfund.org).\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: But, what is \"Ethnography\"? What are \"User Communities\"?\r\n\r\nEthnography is defined as the study of culture and human motivation through qualitative research. Ethnographic practices complement usability studies by tapping into needs and motivations of people and users to give the \"why\" behind certain actions observed solely through conducting usability research. This method includes interviews, observing specific behaviors and understanding the material culture and surrounds of a target group. \r\n\r\nA community is defined as a group of users that can be defined by geography, culture, shared experiences, or shared challenges. User is defined as someone who is currently utilizing a particular IFTs such as Tor, RedPhone, CryptoCat, and/or other privacy, security, anonymity and access enhancing technologies and methodologies created by developers or users themselves. A user may also be defined as a potential user of such technologies and tools.","persons":[{"id":4263,"full_public_name":"Michael Brennan"}],"links":[{"url":"www.opentechfund.org","title":"Open Technology Fund"},{"url":"www.secondmuse.com","title":"SecondMuse"}]},{"id":5564,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-30T12:45:00+01:00","start":"12:45","duration":"02:15","room":"Saal G","slug":"30C3_-_5564_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312301245_-_lightning_talks_day_4_-_nickfarr","title":"Lightning Talks, Day 4","subtitle":"","track":"Other","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[{"id":1041,"full_public_name":"nickfarr"}],"links":[]},{"id":5444,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-30T16:00:00+01:00","start":"16:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal G","slug":"30C3_-_5444_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312301600_-_attacking_homematic_-_sathya_-_malli","title":"Attacking HomeMatic","subtitle":"","track":"Security & Safety","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"HomeMatic is a good working, inexpensive and quickly spreading home automation system supporting wired as well as (partly AES handshake protected) wireless communication.

Since wireless devices are installable without ripping open walls, it is now possible to easily integrate them into an existing building infrastructure. We chose to work with HomeMatic, because we think that through its affordable prices, its good quality and its fast growing portfolio it will become the most widely spread wireless home automation system in Germany.\r\nIn this live hacking presentation we will introduce different mechanisms to attack a HomeMatic system. We will show how to sniff BidCoS packets, how to send arbitrary packets in order to emulate a device (e. g. a HomeMatic central) and to control devices.\r\nSome devices use an AES handshake to verify the sender of a command. But not all devices support the handshake and for many devices it is disabled by default. We will demonstrate several attacks making use of this security issue.\r\nAfter the live hacking part we will give a short introduction into Homegear. Homegear is an interface software, which directly communicates with BidCoS devices and is controllable through XML RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call).

As a community that is so deeply involved with technology, it is imperative for us to comprehend that these developments did not come out of thin air and that we have the choice to follow a different path.\r\nUnderstanding Heideggers notion of enframing as the product of historical rationalization gives us an insight in the relation between the objective, scientific approach to technology and its instrumentalization as a means for domination.\r\nYet it also highlights the subversive potential of hacker cultures. The hackers' playful curiosity and desire to express creativity within the computer-imposed frameworks of formal logic has the potential to transcend code into poetry, reconnecting techne with poiesis and mapping the road towards the revealing nature of technology. Hacking has the potential to elevate abstract technological mechanisms and relations dissociated from the individuality to the plane of the utmost concrete and subjective images. As the creative output of the hacker both adheres to the formal methods of boolean logic and at the same time challenges them by devoiding them of their rational finalities, the positivist rationale of what we hold to be most objective can be turned into an expression of the subject. I will argue that this repositioning of the subject provides the basis for transforming the technological rationale into one that is aimed at liberation.\r\n","persons":[{"id":4082,"full_public_name":"groente"}],"links":[]},{"id":5539,"logo":"/system/logos/5539/medium/Logo_Kombi_S_HG_small.jpg?1386365710","date":"2013-12-30T13:45:00+01:00","start":"13:45","duration":"00:30","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5539_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312301345_-_human_rights_and_technology_-_seb","title":"Human Rights and Technology","subtitle":"\"A New Hope\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\"?","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"This talk aims to shed some light on recent human rights violations in the context of the use of digital information and communications technology, particularly considering the latest disclosures about the surveillance programmes of Western intelligence services.

This phenomenon, often labelled as „digital revolution“, has brought about great improvements in efficiency in the daily lives of many and for society as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe fight for a better protection of human rights has also benefitted vastly from these developments: It is hard to imagine that the „Arab Spring“ movement could have gained the same momentum without the widespread use of modern information and communications media. Classified documents (the leaks by Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden only being the most spectactular ones) bearing witness, for the first time, to human rights violations of a number of states, wouldn't have seen the same spread and publicity without anonymous online whistleblower platforms like WikiLeaks. Today, numerous projects interconnect human rights defenders all around the world through blogs, social networks, short messaging services and smartphone apps. As networks and bandwidths evolve, these technologies more and more enable activists in all parts of the world to compare notes on a global basis, exchange information and experiences, upload evidence of human rights violations and protect themselves more effectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, governments also use these technologies to spy on, track down and detain people that they believe could jeopardise their power. In many cases, these measures affect people who have merely exercised their human rights. States use their capabilities to oppress actions or opinions they do not deem suitable. They covertly eavesdrop on electronic communications on a large scale, thus undermining the anonymity of communication and the privacy of people. They block content or services on the Internet, break into private email accounts, censor opinions through gigantic word filters, or even shut down communications networks in times of civil unrest and political protests.\r\n\r\nThe revelations of the last months concerning the NSA's and GCHQ's surveillance activities by far exceed the dimensions of global communications interception known to the public so far. At the same time, whistleblowers disclosing classified information about human rights violations face severe persecution by State authorities. The EU Directive on blanket telecommunications data retention and dubious EU research projects like INDECT add to the evolving picture that it is not just states with a well-known record of extensive communications interception, filtering and censoring like China, Iran or Saudi Arabia, that seem to attach little value to human rights in digital networks.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few examples of the ambivalent impact of digitisation on human rights. While modern information and communications technologies have yielded new opportunities for individuals to exercise their rights, they have also given rise to new ways for governments to prevent, obstruct or control these activities effectively. Current developments show that the excessive use of government power in this environment imperils the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to privacy and the freedom of expression and information. In fact, governments all over the world these days seem to engage in what could be described as a repressive backlash against the facilitations that modern information and communications technologies have brought about for the exercise of human rights.\r\n\r\nAmnesty International's German section is currently setting up a new task force (preliminarily known as Digital@Amnesty) that focuses on human rights violations in the context of the use of digital information and communications technology. Our mission is to keep a critical eye on the further development of these technologies and to assist in finding a position on the issues arising thereof with a view to the future protection of human rights in a digital environment.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present some aspects of our work, the position Amnesty takes on recent incidents in this field (including a legal assessment from a human rights perspective), and ways to get involved.","persons":[{"id":4150,"full_public_name":"Seb"}],"links":[{"url":"http://www.amnesty.org","title":"Amnesty International"},{"url":"http://www.amnesty.de","title":"Amnesty International, German Section"}]},{"id":5609,"logo":null,"date":"2013-12-30T14:30:00+01:00","start":"14:30","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5609_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312301430_-_infrastructure_review_-_kay_-_peter_stuge_-_florolf_-_sebastian_-_m","title":"Infrastructure Review","subtitle":"Presentation of MOC/NOC/VOC/SOC/*OC","track":"CCC","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"","description":"","persons":[{"id":2200,"full_public_name":"kay"},{"id":2142,"full_public_name":"Peter Stuge"},{"id":3276,"full_public_name":"florolf"},{"id":4446,"full_public_name":"Sebastian"},{"id":3606,"full_public_name":"*m"}],"links":[]},{"id":5293,"logo":"/system/logos/5293/medium/logo_fair-trade-computer_466x500px.png?1385310530","date":"2013-12-30T16:00:00+01:00","start":"16:00","duration":"01:00","room":"Saal 6","slug":"30C3_-_5293_-_de_-_saal_6_-_201312301600_-_dead_man_edition_-_sebastian_jekutsch","title":"Dead Man Edition","subtitle":"Auf dem Weg zu fairer Elektronik am Beispiel der Elkos  [The way to fair electronics, by example of capacitors]","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Die alarmierenden Zustände beim Abbau der Rohstoffe, die in den Bauteilen (z.
